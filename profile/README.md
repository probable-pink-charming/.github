Have you ever played an anime mobile video game, and then wondered. Huh, I wish I could play mod with this game, or rip the assets. Except, usually it will infringe with the copyright licensing of that game. Or the server you're playing or even the game itself is sunsetting!

We're trying to fix that! ðŸ˜Š
